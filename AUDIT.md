# AuthKit Security Audit Documentation

## 🛡️ Security Audit Script

The `scripts/security-audit.js` script performs comprehensive security checks on your AuthKit API according to your exact specifications.

## 📋 Audit Checks

### 1. httpOnly Cookie Check
**What it checks:** Verifies that the `/api/refresh` route sets `httpOnly: true` for refresh token cookies.

**Pass:** ✅ Refresh token cookie has httpOnly protection  
**Fail:** ❌ Critical: Refresh token cookie missing httpOnly! [FIX: npm run fix]

### 2. JWT Expiration Check  
**What it checks:** Ensures `JWT_EXPIRATION` is not longer than 1800 seconds (30 minutes).

**Pass:** ✅ JWT expiration is 900 seconds (within 30 min limit)  
**Warn:** ⚠️ Warn: JWT expiration too long (30+ mins). Reduce to 15 mins.

### 3. API Route Protection Check
**What it checks:** Verifies that `/api/me` route exists and has authentication middleware.

**Pass:** ✅ /api/me route is properly protected with auth middleware  
**Fail:** ❌ Critical: Unprotected route! [FIX: Add auth middleware]

## 🔧 Auto-Fix Functionality

### npm run fix
The `npm run fix` command automatically fixes common security issues:

1. **httpOnly Cookie Fix**
   - Adds `httpOnly: true` to refresh token cookies
   - Modifies `backend/routes/auth.js`

2. **JWT Expiration Fix**
   - Sets `JWT_EXPIRATION=900` (15 minutes) in `.env` file
   - Adds the setting if it doesn't exist

## 📊 Exit Codes

- **Exit Code 0:** All security checks passed ✅
- **Exit Code 1:** Critical security issues found ❌

## 🚀 Usage

### Run Security Audit
```bash
npm run audit

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Files Checked
- `backend/routes/auth.js` - Refresh token route and cookie configuration
- `backend/middleware/cookieAuth.js` - Cookie security middleware
- `backend/routes/user.js` - API route protection
- `.env` - JWT expiration configuration

### Regex Patterns Used
- Refresh route: `/router\.post\s*\(\s*['"`]\/refresh['"`]/gi`
- httpOnly cookie: `/httpOnly:\s*true/gi`
- Secure cookie function: `/setSecureRefreshTokenCookie/gi`
- /me route: `/router\.get\s*\(\s*['"`]\/me['"`]/gi`
- Auth middleware: `/authenticateToken/gi`

## 🛠️ Integration with CI/CD

Add to your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Security Audit
  run: npm run audit
  
# This will fail the build if security issues are found
```
